2. Identification of the data structure(s) associated with system calls.
	Arrays
	Stacks

3. Identification of the files associated with system calls in XV6.
	+  syscall.h
	+  syscall.c
	+  sysproc.c
	+  usys.S
	+  user.h
	+  Source code file - Program making the call

4. An explanation of how you might go about creating a System Call.
	Define call in syscall.h
	Add prototype to call in syscall.c
	Implement system call function call in sysproc.c
	Add interface in usys.S
	Add function to user.h
	Make call to funtion in you source code file
